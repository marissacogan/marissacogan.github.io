  <h1>NFL Week 11 Power Rankings 2024: How all 32 teams stack up</h1>

  <h2>Welcome to Week 11 of the 2024 NFL season!</h2>

  <p>The undefeated Kansas City Chiefs kept rolling Sunday with a win over the Denver Broncos, and the Detroit Lions overcame five picks against the Houston Texans to move to 8-1.</p>

  <p>The drama that was Week 10 started Thursday night when the Baltimore Ravens survived a thriller against the Cincinnati Bengals. The action continued with wins for the Carolina Panthers and New Orleans Saints, and the Washington Commanders lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>

  <p>So how did those games impact this week's rankings? And where do the Arizona Cardinals -- who have won four in a row -- rank? Here's our updated list.</p>

  <p>In addition to the rankings, we asked our NFL Nation reporters to pick non-quarterback MVP for every team at the midseason mark. Quarterbacks typically get all of the love -- and the MVP award at the end of the season -- so we chose to focus on the other stars lighting it up this year. From talented receivers and running backs to tough defenders, we listed players who are having MVP-worthy campaigns.</p>

  <p>Let's start with Kansas City.</p>

  <p>Our power panel of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities evaluates how NFL teams stack up against one another, ranking them from 1 to 32.</p>

  <p>1. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs (9-0)</a></p>
    <p>Week 10 result: Beat the Broncos <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671637/broncos-chiefs">16-14</a></p>
    <p>Week 10 ranking: 1</p>
    
    <p>Non-QB MVP: Defensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044859/chris-jones">Chris Jones</a></p>
    
    <p>Jones has only three sacks, which doesn't even lead his team, but his impact goes well beyond that number. He has a pass rush win rate of 23.4%, which is sixth in the league and first for an interior lineman. He has done this despite facing a double team on almost 60% of snaps, leading the Chiefs in pressure rate at 11.6%. -- Adam Teicher</p>
